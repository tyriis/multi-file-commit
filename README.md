## User Story

As a user I want to push and commit multiple files in 1 commit. if doing it via git push, there is no way to sign the the commit in an action context.
Of course I want to use `only signed commits` restriction on my branches (and I dont want to bypass the restriction to protect my software supply chain).

## The Idea

It is possible to create blobs and tree to create a commit via GitHub API.
I found the solution to the problem here: <https://siddharthav.medium.com/push-multiple-files-under-a-single-commit-through-github-api-f1a5b0b283ae>

Thanks for your work [Siddhartha Varma](https://github.com/BRO3886).

## Limitations

:warning: it cannot be used on empty repositories. \
:warning: parallel commits on the same file lead to a race condition where previous changes are overwritten.

## What's new

- First implementation is currently tested

## Usage

<!-- start usage -->

```yaml
- uses: tyriis/multi-file-commit@v0.1.0
  with:
    # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''

    # The branch you want to push the commit
    # Default: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    ref: ''

    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
    # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run GitHub API commands.
    # Default: ${{ github.token }}
    token: ''

    # The commit message for the commit.
    message: ''

    # A list of files to commit, prevent other staged files to be commited.
    # Example: src/main.mjs,src/main.spec.js
    # If not set all staged files are considered for commit.
    files: ''

    # In case you want to tag your commit, just pass a tag reference and this action will do the work for you.
    tag: ''
```
